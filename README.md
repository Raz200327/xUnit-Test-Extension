## Features

This extension is designed to boost your productivity when working with xUnit in a .NET project.

### üß™ Dedicated Test Explorer

- **Focused View**: A new "xUnit Tester" icon appears in the Activity Bar, opening a view that lists *only* your test files (any file ending in `Tests.cs`).
- **One-Click Test Execution**: Run tests for a specific file by clicking the play icon that appears on hover.
- **Run All Tests**: A "Run All Tests" button is available at the top of the view to execute your entire test suite.
- **Auto-Refresh**: The explorer automatically updates when you create, delete, or rename test files. A manual refresh button is also provided.

### üìÑ Automatic Test File Generation

- **Smart Detection**: Automatically creates a corresponding test file when you create a new C# file ending in `Controller.cs` or `Service.cs`.
- **Organized Structure**: New test files are placed in a configurable test directory, under `Controllers` or `Services` subfolders.
- **Boilerplate Content**: The generated test file includes a basic xUnit class structure, `using` statements, and a sample test method to get you started immediately.
- **Manual Generation**: Right-click any `Controller.cs` or `Service.cs` file in the main File Explorer and select "Generate Test File" to create one on demand.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Seamless Test Runner

- **Integrated Output**: Test results are displayed in a dedicated "Test Runner" output channel, showing the full `dotnet test` command and its results.
- **Context-Aware Commands**:
  - Run tests for the currently open file from the editor's title bar.
  - Run all tests from the Command Palette.

4.  **Run Tests**:
    - Click the main play button at the top of the Test Explorer to run all tests.
    - Hover over a file in the list and click the inline play button to run tests for just that file.
